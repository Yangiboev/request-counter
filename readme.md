<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

  

## About The Repo

  

This is a simple server which is being develeped by Dilmurod
  
* Our time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others

* I should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

* I assume that  the web server is synchronous, if the other case (asynchronous), then I would have to guard my counter using a mutex or atomic in order to prevent my server from being hit with race-condition bugs. However, I believe that locking would be expensive if we get hit a high-performance scenario.

* After considering a high-performance scenarios that thousands of requests could come in at the very same time, I thought that I need proper synchronization. The concurrency model of golang makes it easy to serialize all accesses to the application's state: no (explicit) mutexes are required.
